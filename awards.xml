		<name>Public Communication Award - University of Southampton</name>
		<description>The Public Communication Award was given to two students in the third year for a project to be self-standing and for use in recruitment on open days for the University. It came with an award of £1200 and <a href="projects/columbus.php">my robot</a> is used to convince students to come to Southampton. </description>

		<name>EMECS-thon Best Commercial Implementation</name>
		<description>
			The EMECS-thon is a 48 hour embedded system design marathon for students from Southampton University, University of Kaiserslautern and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology to partake in. Teams consisted of three members and the project can be anything within budget and has to use the MBED development board.<br/>
			My team decided on making a drum sequencer, cabable of playing a full bar of drums repeatedly and being able to be altered. The system also had prestored sequences that could be cycled through and variable tempo.
			<br/>
			The system used the MBED to do all the sequencing and audio playback. There was also an Atmel ATMega644P connected to control and read the bipolar LED and button matrix. The system, on a whole, worked well apart from the button debouncing and sailed Team Dan to success with rewards of Raspberry Pis.<br/>

		<name>D4 Design Challange - Winning Team</name>
		<description>
			The D4 Design Competition is a prestigious event that occurs annually at the School of Electronic at Southampton. The competition is done over 3 weeks in teams of 6, and students have to build, design and test a given project. A certain amount of freedom was given to the students to make their own good (and bad) decisions. My years project was to build a fully autonomous football playing robot. The prize was £100 each from the sponsor Detica and I helped my team to success in claiming the prize.<br/>
			The project we were given was to make a football playing robot. The device should be fully autonomous, responding to light, sound and attempt to score a goal. <br/>
			My role in this was designing and building the AI to play football, extracting debug information from the system and coordinating the hardware aspects of the design. Though the end result was a little messy, and no football was ever played, the robot was a a result of 3 weeks of hard work and effort. <br/>

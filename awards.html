					<h3>EMECS-thon Best Commercial Implementation</h3>
					<p>The EMECS-thon is a 48 hour embedded system design marathon for students from Southampton University, University of Kaiserslautern and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology to partake in. Teams consist of three members and the project can be anything within budget and has to use the MBED development board.</p>
                    <p>My team decided on making a drum sequencer, cabable of playing a full bar of drums repeatedly and being able to be altered. The system also had prestored sequences that could be cycled through and variable tempo.</p>
                    <p>The system used the MBED to do all the sequencing and audio playback. There was also an Atmel ATMega644P connected to control and read the bipolar LED and button matrix. The system, on a whole, worked well apart from the button debouncing and sailed Team Dan to success with rewards of Raspberry Pis.</p>

                    <h3>D4 Design Challange - Winning Team</h3>
					<p>The D4 Design Competition is a prestigious event that occurs annually at the School of Electronic at Southampton. The competition is done over 3 weeks and students have to build, design and test a given project. A certain amount of freedom was given to the students to make their own good (and bad) decisions. My years project was to build a fully autonomous football playing robot. The prize was £100 from the sponsor Detica and I helped my team to success in claiming the prize.</p>
                    <p>My role in this was designing and building the AI to play football, extracting debug information and coordinating the entire build. Though the end result was a little messy, and no football was ever played, the robot was a a result of 3 weeks of hard work and effort. </p>

                    <h3>Duke of Edinburgh Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards</h3>
					<p>I undertook and completed all of the Duke of Edinburghs Awards. The main highlight of these were the expeditions. I got to explore the Lake District, Peak District, Wolds and Cheviots with friends living off what we carried on our backs.</p>
					<h3>Addison Award of Eningeering - King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth</h3>
					<p>This awards was given by my school to the Student moving on to the best Engineering degree after leaving year 13. It was a £250 reward for getting where I desired to be.</p>
                    <h3>Duke of Westminster's Award - Nominee</h3>
					<p>My Maths teacher and Cadet Commanding Officer Nominated me for this award, which assesses leadership in individuals, for my efforts and commitment within the CCF at school. I reached the final 40 nominees, but unfortunately made it no further. </p>
                    <h3> 'Cello Grade 3</h3>
                    <p>I played the 'Cello for 6 years and was part of Ensembles and Orchestras. I thoroghouly enjoyed playing this instrument and regret stopping. I hope to some day pick it back up.</p>

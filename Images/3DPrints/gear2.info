Object from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451"> here</a>.<br/>
My second attempt at this print! I found an option in Slic3r to split an object. I clicked this and it recognised the 8 different parts and ensured that they all were printed individually. It took a small amount of force to free it up and it works brilliantly!

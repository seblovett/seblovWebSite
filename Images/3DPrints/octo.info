This print is from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27053">Thingiverse</a>. It took about 2 hours 45 minutes to print. <br/>
It has a few problems - one of the edges on the raised tentacle is a bit rough, and the overhangs in the eyes are a bit droopy. I didn't use a fan to cool this, which could have improved things.

A Raspberry Pi case from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:43587">Thingiverse </a>.

It printed well, though needed a little bit of filing down to fit my power supply. It is a snug fit, and the two parts fit together well. I attached the case to the back of my monitor and I printed a small extension plate to help with this. Next step for this is to make a case that will fit the mounts on the back of the monitor.

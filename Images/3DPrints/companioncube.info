Another from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13588">Thingiverse</a>. This came out reasonably well. The top is a bit messy. I'm going to try this one again soon with cooling to try get better results. It took over an hour to print. It has given me the idea to design (or find a design of) the switch from Portal and make that into a working switch.

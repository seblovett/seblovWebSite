These a quite basic robots. They built reasonably well. A bit of oozebane from the arms to the head at the top, but it isn't much and easily removed. I found an external fan greatly increased the quality. <br/>There is meant to be "Make" printed on their backs, but this isn't very clear - showing the limitations of my printer compared to a MakerBot which these are designed for.

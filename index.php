                            <p class="blog">I am a fourth year Electronic Engineering student at the University of Southampton. I
                            began my interest in Electronics at GCSE level, building simple circuits and testing them. This
                            inspired me to take it to a higher level at University along with some hobbyist electronics along the
                            way. A large proportion of my interest is now in Embedded Systems, automation, robotics and
                            computers.<br/>
                            This website is a summary of me, my projects of both academic and hobbyist, my achievements and
                            maybe some other things. Feel free to browse the site and contact me if you have any queries. My
                            Curriculum Vitae is also availiable

                            <p class="blog">After much deliberation, I have bought a 3D printer. I went for a <a href="http://reprappro.com/products/huxley/">Huxley Rep Rap</a>. It's quite a small printer, but I thought it would suit my needs. I will be posting a project on my experiences with it when I get it!</p>

                            <p class="blog">My summer is being spent in Whitely working at Atmel for the second year. This year, I'm working on multiple larger projects. So far, my internship has been enjoyable. I have learnt Python and XSL languages, as well as seeing how a large scale firmware project is maintained.</p>

                            <p class="blog">I have just completed my third year at University. I now have a B Eng in Electronic Engineering. The last semesters results ranged from 72-92%. The 92% was in Digital Control System Design as is my highest mark at Uni. I'm very pleased with my result and my hard work has paid off. </p>
